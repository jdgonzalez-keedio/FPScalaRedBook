## PART 1 INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
1. WHAT IS FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING?
	1.1. The benefits of FP: a simple example
		1.1.1. A program with side effects
		1.1.2. A functional solution: removing the side effects
	1.2. Exactly what is a (pure) function?
	1.3. Referential transparency, purity, and the substitution model
	1.4. Summary

2. GETTING STARTED WITH FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING IN SCALA
	2.1. Introducing Scala the language: an example
	2.2. Running our program
	2.3. Modules, objects, and namespaces
	2.4. Higher-order functions: passing functions to functions
		2.4.1. A short detour: writing loops functionally
		2.4.2. Writing our first higher-order function
	2.5. Polymorphic functions: abstracting over types
		2.5.1. An example of a polymorphic function
		2.5.2. Calling HOFs with anonymous functions
	2.6. Following types to implementations
